# OSU-RM2020-CV
Unless if we switch to other code hosting services, this is going to be the main repo for OSU Robomaster team, software group.

It may have multiple organized branches for testing and running, but for now, this is just where all code goes.

This is a public repo, so everyone has access to all the code. if anyone who wants to push his/her code to this repo, join our Teams and post your email. An invataion link is going to be sent to you.
